# HTML5-Gambling-Game-Tech-Test

# A technical test to create a gambling game given a bunch of assets
# Deadline: 1 week
# Time spent: 16 hours

For this task, we would like you toâ€¦

1. Create the layout using HTML and CSS.
2. Create the mini-game logic using JavaScript or jQuery library.

The logic:
There are 9 boxes and each of them contains a multiplier. There are only 3 different multipliers available, each of them being available in 3 of the boxes in random positions. When you press spin, the wheel will rotate and will stop at a random number. The number will indicate the box that will open and will reveal the multiplier. After the second spin a new box will open and if the multiplier inside is the same as the one of the previous spin, you win that multiplier. Otherwise, both boxes will close and you can try again until you match two boxes that have the same multiplier (similar to a memory game).

In the folder you will find all the graphic resources that you need and also a video for reference. 

Best of luck, we look forward to seeing what you can produce.


Feedback: "while the code was clean, did not use jquery or the specified framework"
