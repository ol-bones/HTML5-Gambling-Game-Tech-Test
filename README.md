# HTML5-Gambling-Game-Tech-Test

# A technical test to create a gambling game given a bunch of assets
# Deadline: 1 week
# Time spent: 16 hours

# Made all the features but didn't bother making final touches to make it look pretty
# the elements aren't aligned and sized properly, the fonts are wrong and
# the particles aren't activated (a particle class exists though, only 1 particle
# is emitted on page load).
